# Isabot - Is it a bot?

Isabot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he has, etc!

### Running Isabot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following.

You can start isabot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output about where your scripts come from and a
prompt:

    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading adapter shell
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/scripts
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/src/scripts
    Hubot>

Then you can interact with Isabot by typing `isabot help`.

    Hubot> isabot help

    Hubot> animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few
    convert me <expression> to <units> - Convert expression to given units.
    help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.
    ...


### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md).

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
the thing.

### hubot-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead
of writing it yourself, you can check
[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] for existing scripts.

To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with
extension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this
repo.

[hubot-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts

### external-scripts

Hubot is able to load scripts from third-party `npm` package. Check the package's documentation, but in general it is:

1. Add the packages as dependencies into your `package.json`
2. `npm install` to make sure those packages are installed
3. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

You can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.

##  Persistence

If you are going to use the `hubot-redis-brain` package
(strongly suggested), you will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified
account or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually
set the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.

    % heroku config:add REDISTOGO_URL="..."

If you don't require any persistence feel free to remove the
`hubot-redis-brain` from `external-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry
about redis at all.

## Adapters

Adapters are the interface to the service you want your hubot to run on. This
can be something like Campfire or IRC. In our case, we're using the [Slack adapter](https://github.com/tinyspeck/hubot-slack). There are a number of third party
adapters that the community have contributed. Check
[Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters] for the available ones.

If you would like to run a non-Campfire or shell adapter you will need to add
the adapter package as a dependency to the `package.json` file in the
`dependencies` section.

Once you've added the dependency and run `npm install` to install it you can
then run hubot with the adapter.

    % bin/hubot -a <adapter>

Where `<adapter>` is the name of your adapter without the `hubot-` prefix.

[hubot-adapters]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md

## Deployment

    % heroku create heroku-app-name
    % git push heroku master

If your Heroku account has been verified you can run the following to enable
and add the Redis to Go addon to your app.

    % heroku addons:add redistogo:nano

If you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].

You'll need to edit the `Procfile` to set the name of your hubot.

More detailed documentation can be found on the
[deploying hubot onto Heroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.


## Environment Variables

Isabot depends on a few local environment variables. You can find these below. In order to run locally with these variables, you'll need to create a `.env` file. See the example env.template for syntax. After adding your environment variables the `.env`, you'll need to run `source .env` to load them. This will need to occur before running `bin/hubot`.

    % HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL //Find more at https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-heroku-keepalive

## Alright, brain overload already. I'm ready to play

Run the command below in the #general channel of [Slack](http://slack.com) to check it out. Note: The name 'spec' below matches whatever variable is set via the variable HUBOT\_SLACK\_BOTNAME.

```
spec hello
```

### Deploying to UNIX or Windows

If you would like to deploy to either a UNIX operating system or Windows.
Please check out the [deploying hubot onto UNIX][deploy-unix] and
[deploying hubot onto Windows][deploy-windows] wiki pages.

## Slack Variables

Isabot is currently connected to the [Slack adapter](https://github.com/tinyspeck/hubot-slack). 

This adapter uses the following environment variables:

#### HUBOT\_SLACK\_TOKEN

This is the service token you are given when you add Hubot to your Team Services.

#### HUBOT\_SLACK\_TEAM

This is your team's Slack subdomain. For example, if your team is `https://myteam.slack.com/`, you would enter `myteam` here.

#### HUBOT\_SLACK\_BOTNAME

Optional. What your Hubot is called on Slack. If you entered `slack-hubot` here, you would address your bot like `slack-hubot: help`. Otherwise, defaults to `slackbot`.

#### HUBOT\_SLACK\_CHANNELMODE

Optional. If you entered `blacklist`, Hubot will not post in the rooms specified by HUBOT_SLACK_CHANNELS, or alternately *only* in those rooms if `whitelist` is specified instead. Defaults to `blacklist`.

#### HUBOT\_SLACK\_CHANNELS

Optional. A comma-separated list of channels to either be blacklisted or whitelisted, depending on the value of HUBOT_SLACK_CHANNELMODE.

#### HUBOT\_SLACK\_LINK\_NAMES

Optional. By default, Slack will not linkify channel names (starting with a '#') and usernames (starting with an '@'). You can enable this behavior by setting HUBOT_SLACK_LINK_NAMES to 1. Otherwise, defaults to 0. See [Slack API : Message Formatting Docs](https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting) for more information.

## Under the Hood

#### Receiving Messages:

The slack adapter adds a path to the robot's router that will accept POST requests to:

`/hubot/slack-webhook`

Source: [https://github.com/tinyspeck/hubot-slack/blob/2.2.0/src/slack.coffee#L161-L177](https://github.com/tinyspeck/hubot-slack/blob/2.2.0/src/slack.coffee#L161-L177)

Expected parameters:

- text
- user_id
- user_name
- channel_id
- channel_name

If there is a message and it can deduce an author from those paramters, it'll create a new [TextMessage](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/v2.7.2/src/message.coffee#L14) object and have the robot receive it, from there proceeding down the regular hubot path.

#### Sending Messages

When a script calls `send()` or `reply()` this adapter makes a POST request to your team's specific URL webhook:

`https://<your_team_name>.slack.com/services/hooks/hubot`

with a JSON-formatted body including the following dictionary:

- username
- channel
- text
- link_names (optionally)

#### Message to a specific room:

Sometime, it's useful to send a message regardless of the channel's activity (like `robot.hear` or `robot.response`). Hubot has [`robot.messageRoom`](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/v2.8.0/src/robot.coffee#L401-L409) available for this use case.

Slack API uses channel ID's by default, which uses computer-friendly alphanumeric ID. To use the pretty names, prefix it with a hash.

```coffeescript
robot.respond /hello$/i, (msg) ->
  robot.messageRoom '#general', 'hello there'
```

## Restart the bot

You may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart`
if you're having issues.
